Shark Alert! YOLO AI-Vision in Action

Last week, several news outlets ran a story about SharkEye, which is an AI-vision shark detection program, developed at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and deployed at California’s Padaro Beach, which is an area where surfers and great white sharks are both frequently found.

After quickly describing the program itself, the video identifies the underlying technology that was used for the vision aspect, confirming from the project’s GitHub page that YOLO v8 by Ultralytics was used.

Basically, Ultralytics created an abstraction layer that simplifies the deployment of computer vision models, so that even developers with almost no experience in computer vision can quickly implement sophisticated projects. To illustrate, the video then shows a demo of an object detection and identification task being set up and run on Google Colab. It then concludes with examples of types of projects that can be implemented by Ultralytics YOLO v8.
